[^4]What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music. It is with him as with the poor wretches in Phalris's bronze bull, who were slowly tortured over a slow fire; their screams could not reach the tyrant's ears to terrify him; to him they sounded like sweet music.[^5] And people crowd around the poet and say to him, "Sing again soon"---in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul, and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming. And the reviewers step up and say, "That is right; so it must be according to the rules of esthetics." Now of course a reviewer resembles a poet to a hair, except that he does not have the anguish in his heart, or the music on his lips. Therefore, I would rather be a swineherd out on Amager[^6] and be understood by swine than be a poet and be misunderstood by people. [^7]

[^11]I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding---the motion is too powerful; I don't feel like walking---it is too tiring; I don't feel like lying down, for either I would have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that, or I would have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. *Summa Summarum*: I don't feel like doing anything.

[...]

[^15]Generally speaking, the imperfection in everything human is that its aspirations are achieved only by way of their opposites. I shall not discuss the variety of formations, which can give a psychologist plenty to do (the melancholy have the best sense of the comic, the most opulent often the best sense of the rustic, the dissolute often the best sense of the moral, the doubter often the best sense of the religious), but merely call to mind that it is through sin that one gains a first glimpse of salvation.

[...]

[^20]It is cause for alarm to note with what hypochondriac profundity Englishmen of an earlier generation have spotted the ambiguity basic to laughter. Thus Dr. Hartley[^21] has observed: dass wenn sich das Lachen zuerst bei Kindern zeiget, so ist es ein entstehendes Weinen, welches durch Schmerz erregt wird, oder ein plötzlich gehemtes und in sehr kurzen Zwischenraümen wiederholtes Gefühl des Schmerzens [that when laughter first makes its appearance in a child, it is a nascent cry that is excited by pain or a suddenly arrested feeling of pain repeated at very short intervals] (see Flögel, *Geschichte der comischen Litteratur*,[^22] I, p. 50). What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding; what if laughter really were weeping!

[...]

[^38]I have, I believe, the courage to doubt everything; I have, I believe, the courage to fight against everything; but I do not have the courage to acknowledge anything, the courage to possess, to own, anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic that things do not go in life as in the novel, where opportunity is always so favorable. I complain that in life it is not as in the novel, where one has hardhearted fathers and nisses and trolls to battle, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such adversaries together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious-of-life nocturnal forms with which I battle and to which I myself give life and existence.

[...]

[^52]On the whole, I lack the patience to live. I cannot see the grass grow, and if I cannot do that, I do not care to look at it at all. My views are the superficial observations of a "*fahrender Scholastiker* [traveling scholastic]"[^53] who dashes through life in the greatest haste. It is said that our Lord satisfies the stomach before the eyes. That is not what I find: my eyes are surfeited and bored with everything, and yet I hunger.

[...]

[^108]Tautology is and remains the highest principle, the highest maxim of thought.[^109] No wonder, then, that most people use it. It is not so impoverished, either, and can well fill out a whole life. It has a jesting, witty, entertaining form; this is [the category of] infinite judgements.[^110] This kind of tautology is the paradoxical and transcendental kind. It has the serious, scientific, and edifying form. The formula is as follows: when two quantities are equal in size to one and the same third quantity, they are all of equal size.[^111] This is a quantitative conclusion. This kind of tautology is especially useful on podiums and in pulpits, where one must say much.

**Either/Or**[^114]\\
*An Ecstatic Discourse*

Marry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way.[^115] Whether you marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the stupidities of the world, and you will regret it; weep over them, and you will also regret it. Laugh at the stupidities of the world or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Whether you laugh at the stupidities of the world or you weep over them, you will regret it either way. Trust a girl, and you will regret it. Do not trust her, and you will also regret it. Trust a girl or do not trust her, you will regret it either way. Whether you trust a girl or do not trust her, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, and you will regret it. Do not hang yourself, and you will also regret it. Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the quintessence of all the wisdom of life. It is not merely in isolated moments that I, as Spinoza says, view everything *aeterno modo* [in the mode of eternity][^116], but I am continually *aeterno modo*. Many believe they, too, are this when after doing one thing or another they unite or mediate these opposites. But this is a misunderstanding, for the true eternity does not lie behind either/or but before it. Their eternity will therefore also be a painful temporal sequence, since they will have a double regret on which to live. My wisdom is easy to grasp, for I have only one maxim, and even that is not a point of departure for me. One must differentiate between the subsequent dialectic in either/or and the eternal one suggested here. So when I say that my maxim is not a point of departure for me, this does not have the opposite of being a point of departure but is merely the negative expression of my maxim, that by which it comprehends itself in contrast to being a point of departure or not being a point of departure. My maxim is not a point of departure for me, because if I made it a point of departure, I would regret it, and if I did not make it a point of departure, I would also regret it. If one or another of my esteemed listeners thinks there is anything to what I have said, he merely demonstrates that he has no head for philosophy. If he thinks there is any movement in what has been said, this demonstrates the same thing. But for those listeners who are able to follow me, although I do not move, I shall now elucidate the eternal truth by which this philosophy is self-contained and does not concede anything higher. That is, if I made my maxim a point of departure, then I would be unable to stop, for if I did not stop, I would regret it, and if I did stop, I would also regret it, etc. But if I never start, then I can always stop, for my eternal starting is my eternal stopping. Experience shows that it is not at all difficult for philosophy to begin. Far from it. It begins, in fact, with nothing[^117] and therefore can always begin. But it is always difficult for philosophy and philosophers to stop. This difficulty, too, I have avoided, for if anyone thinks that I, in stopping now, actually stop, he demonstrates that he does not have speculative comprehension. The point is that I do not stop now, but I stopped when I began. My philosophy, therefore, has the advantageous characteristic of being brief and of being irrefutable, for if anyone disputes me, I daresay I have the right to declare him mad. The philosopher, then, is continually *aeterno modo* and does not have, as did the blessed Sintenis, only specific hours that are lived for eternity.[^118]

	*Refrains*

	*ad se ipsum*

	all the separate observations that are already worked out may well be collected. They are scattered elements of a view of life that is not only personal but also scholarly, yet precisely because of this duplexity, cancels itself and once again ends in either/or.---*Pap*. II B 175 *n.d.*, 1842

	> As for my gift, it is time you heard where and how I got this bull. I did not order it of the sculptor myself---I hope I may never be so insane as to want such things!---but there was a man in our town called Perilaus, a good metal-worker but a bad man. Completely missing my point of view, this fellow thought to do me a favour by inventing a new punishment, imagining that I wanted to punish people in any and every way. So he made the bull and came to me with it, a very beautiful thing to look at and a very close copy of nature; motion and voice were all it needed to make it seem actually alive. At the sight of it I cried out at once: "The thing is good enough for Apollo; we must send the bull to the god!" But Perilaus at my elbow said: "What if you knew the trick of it and the purpose it serves?" With that he opened the bull's back and said: "If you wish to punish anyone, make him get into this contrivance and lock him up; then attach these flutes to the nose of the bull and have a fire lighted underneath. The man will groan and shriek in the grip of unremitting pain, and his voice will make you the sweetest possible music on the flutes, piping dolefully and lowing piteously; so that while he is punished you are entertained by having flutes played to you." When I heard this, I was disgusted with the wicked ingenuity of the fellow and hated the idea of the contrivance, so I gave him a punishment that fitted his crime. "Come now, Perilaus," said I, "if this is not mere empty boasting, show us the real nature of the invention by getting into it yourself and imitating people crying out, so that we may know whether the music you speak of is really made on the flutes." Perilaus complied, and when he was inside, I locked him up and had a fire kindled underneath saying: "Take the reward you deserve for your wonderful invention, and as you are our music-master, play the first tune yourself!" So, he, indeed, got his deserts by thus having the enjoyment of his ingenuity. But I had the fellow taken out while he was still alive and breathing, that he might not pollute the work by dying in it; then I had him thrown over a cliff to lie unburied, and after purifying the bull, sent it to you to be dedicated to the god. I also had the whole story inscribed on it---my name as the giver; that of Perilaus, the maker; his idea; my justice; the apt punishment; the songs of the clever metal-worker and the first trial of his music.

[^6]: An island across the ship channel from Copenhagen proper. In Kierkegaard's time, the truck gardens and small farms of Amager produced considerable foodstuffs for the city.

[^7]: The first [greek] is really the task of the entire work, which is not resolved until the last words of the sermon. An enormous dissonance is assumed, and then it says: Explain it. A total break with actuality is assumed, which does not have its base in futility but in mental depression and its predominance over actuality.

	The last [greek] tells us how a life such as this has found its satisfactory expression in laughter. He pays his debt to actuality by means of laughter, and now everything takes place within this contradiction. His enthusiasm is too intense, his sympathy too deep, his love too burning, his heart too warm to be able to express himself in any other way than by contradiction. Thus A himself would never have come to a decision to publish his papers.---*JP* V 5629 (*Pap*. IV A 216)*n.d.*, 1843

[^11]: I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like walking---it is tiring; I don't feel like walking down, for either I would lie down for a long time, and I don't feel like doing that, or I would get up right away, and I don't feel like that either---I don't feel like riding---the motion is too vigorous for my apathy; I don't feel like doing anything except just taking a drive, indolently, smoothly, undulating along, letting objects in abundance glide by, pausing at every beautiful spot merely to feel my listlessness---my ideas and impulses are just as barren as a eunuch's desire.---I seek in vain for something to stimulate me---not even the pithy language of the Middle Ages is able to destroy the emptiness that prevails in me---now I really feel the meaning of the expression about Christ's words[^103] that they are life and spirit---to be brief: I do not feel like writing what I have written here, and I do not feel like erasing it either.---*JP* V 5251 (*Pap*. II A 637) *n.d.*, 1837

[^15]: Generally speaking, the imperfection in everything human is that its aspirations are achieved only by way of their opposites. I shall not discuss the variety of formations, which can give psychologists plenty to do (the melancholy have the best sense of the comic, the most opulent often the best sense of the rustic, the dissolute often the best sense of the moral, the doubter often the best sense of the religious), but it is through sin that one gains a first glimpse of salvation. Therefore, the imperfection consists not so much in the opposite as in one's not being able to see one thing and its opposite *simultaneously*.---*JP* I 700 (*Pap*. III A 112) *n.d.*, 1841

[^20]: I am strangely alarmed when I note the hypochondriac profundity with which Englishmen of an earlier generation have spotted the ambiguity basic to laughter, as Dr. Hartley has observed. What if laughter were completely misunderstood, what if the world were so bad and existence so unhappy that laughter really is weeping? What if it were a misunderstanding---a misunderstanding caused by a compassionate genius or a mocking demon---?

[^38]: I have, I believe, the courage to doubt everything; I have, I believe, the courage to fight against everything; but I do not have the courage to acknowledge anything, the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic that things do not go in life as in novels, where the lovers are so fortunate. I complain that life is not as it is in novels, where one has hardhearted fathers to struggle against, maidens' bowers to force open, convent walls to storm. I have only the pale, bloodless, tenacious-of-life nocturnal forms to struggle against, to which I myself give life and existence.---*JP* I 801 (*Pap*. II A 218) November 16, 1840

[^52]: On the whole, I lack the patience to live; to acquire children seems ridiculous to me; where would I find time to wait for them to grow up---I cannot see the grass grow, but if I cannot do that, I do not care to look at it. My views are the superficial observations of a "*fahrende Skolastisker* [traveling scholastic]" who dashes through life in the greatest haste. It is said that our Lord satisfies the stomach before the eyes; it is not so with me---my eyes are surfeited and bored with everything, although I hunger---*Pap*. II B 179:8 *n.d.*, 1841--42

[^109]: Stilpo of Megara (c. 4 B.C.), teacher of Zeno the Stoic, maintained that universal concepts have no objects and that consequently there are only identical or tautological propositions. Every perception has only a particular object, and no universal predicates can be applied. See Supplement, p. 527 (*Pap*. IV A 219). See, for example, G.W.F. Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik*, I, *Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Werke. Vollständige Ausgabe*, I--XVIII, ed. Philip Marheineke et al. (Berlin: 1832--45; *ASKB* 549--65), IV, pp. 30, 32, 34; *Sämtliche Werke. Jubiläumsausgabe [J.A.]*, I--XXVI, ed. Hermann Glockner (Stuttgart: 1927--40), IV, pp. 508, 510, 512; *Hegel's Science of Logic*, (tr. of W.L. Lasson ed, 1923; Kierkegaard had 2 ed., 1833--34) tr. A. V. Miller (New York: Humanities Press, 1969), pp. 411, 413, 414:

	>**A. Identity**

	>1. Essence is simple immediacy as sublated immediacy. Its negativity is its being; it is self-equal in its absolute negativity, through which otherness and relation-to-other has vanished in its own self into pure equality-with-self. Essence is therefore simple identity-with-self.

	>2. This identity-with-self is the *immediacy* of reflection. It is not that equality-with-self that *being* or even *nothing* is, but the equality-with-self that has brought itself to unity, not a restoration of itself from an other, but this pure origination from and within itself, *essential* identity.

	>*Remark 2: First Original Law of Thought*

	>In this remark, I will consider in more detail identity as the law of identity which is usually adduced as the first law of thought.

	>This proposition in its positive expression A = A is, in the first instance, noth8ing more than the expression of a simple *tautology*. It has therefore been rightly remarked that this law of thought has *no content* and leads no further.

	>Now as regards other confirmation of the absolute *truth of the law* of identity, this is based on *experience* in so far as appeal is made to the experience of every consciousness; for anyone to whom this proposition A = A, *a tree is a tree*, is made, immediately admits it and is satisfied that the proposition as immediately self-evident requires no further confirmation or proof.

[^110]:See Niels Treschow, *Almindelig Logik* (Copenhagen: 1813), pp. 157--59; Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik*, II, *Werke*, V, pp. 90--91; *J.A.*, V, pp. 90--91; *Science of Logic*, pp. 641--43:

	>(c) *The Infinite Judgement*...

	>The positive moment of the infinite judgement, of the negation of the negation, is the *reflection of individuality* into itself, whereby it is posited for the first time as a *determinate determinateness*. According to that reflection, the expression of the judgement was: *the individual is individual*. In the judgement of existence, the subject appears as an *immediate* individual and consequently rather as a mere *something* in general. It is through the mediation of the negative and infinite judgements that it is for the first time *posited* as an individual.

	>The individual is hereby *posited* as continuing itself *into its predicate*, which is identical with it; consequently, too, the universality no longer appears as *immediate* but as a *comprehension* of distinct terms. The positively infinite judgement equally runs: *the universal is universal*, and as such is equally posited as the return into itself.

[^111]: See Hegel, *Wissenschaft der Logik*, II, *Werke*, V, p. 139; *J.A.*, V, p. 139; *Science of Logic*, p. 690.

	>As the immediate result of this bare abstraction, we obtain, of course, a *fourth figure* of the syllogism, namely that of the *relationless* syllogism *U-U-U*, which abstracts from the qualitative difference of the terms and consequently has for its determination their merely external unity, namely their *equality*.

	>(d) *The Fourth Figure: U-U-U, or the Mathematical Syllogism*
	>1. The mathematical syllogism runs: if two things or determinations are equal to a third, they are equal to each other. Here the relationship of inheritance or subsumption of the terms is extinguished.

[^114]:"Either/Or" is a talisman with which the whole world can be demolished.---*JP* I 756 (Pap. III B 179:27) *n.d.*, 1842

	These words Either/Or are a double-edged dagger I carry with me and with which I can assassinate the whole of actuality [*Virkelighed*]. I just say: Either/Or. Either it is this or it is that; since nothing in life is either this or that, it does not, of course, exist. I have watched conjurers do their acts, heard them explain it, seen the crowd amazed, but all the same I have done far more singular things with my magic formula. One can explain everything away---indeed, one can help oneself superbly. That is, a person always lives in such a way that he has a few elements of everything in himself; thus no devil can make him out: either he is a deceiver, and there are some indications of that, or he is not, and there is some evidence of that---ergo, he does not exist at all. That is: ergo, we let him stand, as the peasant said of the Round Tower. ---*Pap*. II B 179:62 *n.d.*, 1841--42
	
	>*From A's Papers*\\
	>Either/Or
	>
	>An Ecstatic Discourse
	
	...seek wisdom, and you will regret it; shun wisdom, and you will regret it; seek wisdom or shun it, you will regret it either way; whether you seek wisdom or you shun it, you will regret it either way...
	
	My philosophy, therefore, has the advantageous characteristic of being brief and of being irrefutable, for if anyone disputes it, he of course thereby proves that he has not understood it.\*
	
	*In Margin* \*Therefore, I have not like some philosophers canceled the principle [*Grundstœtning*] of contradiction by going beyond, because, not to speak of the danger involved in such a step, which necessarily must give a frightful start [*Sœt*] and shock in the whole body, something not easily overcome, it is also dubious to have such a subject [*Undersaat*] or, more correctly, two subjects. To be sure, at times one does see someone riding two horses, which in itself is ingenious enough, but I have never seen anyone ride a horse and an ass, or a horse and an elephant. I am victorious over the principle of contradiction, because it cannot reach me.
	
	It has two sides, length and breadth or, to express myself more concisely, shortness and narrowness. It apparently proceeds from the phenomenon just as I have shown in the first four sentences, but it is apparent, for it is beyond the phenomenon before it proceeds from it; it returns to the phenomenon apparently, for it never reaches it, since the true philosopher is continually *aeterno modo* [in the eternal mode] and does not, like Professor Brorson, have only a few hours lived for eternity. --- This philosophy is to be recommended also in practical respects, for it has been victorious over the most dangerous enemy, death, for death is obviously tricked when it finds me dead beforehand. ---*Pap*. II B 179:63 *n.d.*, 1842--43
	
	The universalized interpretation of this particular thesis---Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way---is, so to speak, the epitome of all the wisdom of life; and the personal relationship a teacher should always have to his pupil is best designated by: May it be to your good [*Velbekomme*]. We cannot, however, say to a person what would otherwise be considered the very best: The best thing for you is to go and hang yourself, for we have to say: Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. ---*JP* II 2586 (*Pap*. II A 117) *n.d.*, 1841

	>PROP. XXXVI. *The intellectual love of the mind towards God is that very love of God whereby God loves himself, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he can be explained through the essence of the human mind regarded under the form of eternity; in other words, the intellectual love of the mind towards God is part of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself.*
	>
	>PROP. XL. *In proportion as each thing possesses more of perfection, so is it more active, and less passive; and, vice versa, in proportion as it is more active, so it is more perfect.*
	>*Proof*.---In proportion as each thing is more perfect, it possesses more of reality (II, Def. vi.), and, consequently (III.iii. and note), it is to that extent more active and less passive. This demonstration may be reversed, and thus prove that, in proportion as a thing is more active, so it is more perfect. *Q.E.D.*
	>*Corollary*.---Hence it follows that the part of the mind which endures, be it great or small, is more perfect than the rest. For the eternal part of the mind (V.xxiii. xxix.) is the understanding, through which alone we are said to act (III.iii.); the part which we have shown to perish is the imagination (V.xxxi.), through which only we are said to be passive (III.iii. and general Def. of the emotions); therefore, the former, be it great or small, is more perfect than the latter. *Q.E.D.*
	>*Note*.---Such are the doctrines which I had purposed to set forth concerning the mind, in so far as it is regarded without relation to the body; whence, as also from I.xxi. and other places, it is plain that our mind, in so far as it understands, is an eternal mode of thinking, which is determined by another eternal mode of thinking, and this other by a third, and so on to infinity; so that all taken together at once constitute the eternal and infinite intellect of God.

	>**WITH WHAT MUST THE SCIENCE BEGIN?**
	>
	>It is only in recent times that thinkers have become aware of the difficulty of finding a beginning in philosophy, and the reason for this difficulty and for the possibility of resolving it has been much discussed. What philosophy begins with must be either *mediated* or *immediate*, and it is easy to show that it can be neither the one nor the other; thus either way of beginning is refuted.
	>
	>But if no presupposition is to be made and the beginning itself is taken *immediately*, then its only determination is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. All that is present is simply the resolve, which can also be regarded as arbitrary, that we propose to consider thought as such. Thus the beginning must be an *absolute*, or what is synonymous here, an *abstract beginning; and so it may not presuppose anything*, must not be mediated by anything nor have a ground; rather it is to be itself the ground of the entire science. Consequently, it must be purely and simply *an* immediacy, or rather merely *immediacy* itself.
	>
	>If it were not this pure indeterminateness, if it were determinate, it would have been taken as something mediated, something already carried a stage further: what is determinate implies an other to a first. Therefore, it lies in the *very nature of a beginning* that it must be being and nothing else. To enter into philosophy, therefore, calls for no other preparations, no further reflections or points of connection.
	>
	>But the determination of *being* so far adopted for the beginning could also be omitted, so that the only demand would be that a pure beginning be made. In that case, we have nothing but the *beginning* itself, and it remains to be seen what this is. ...
	>
	>As yet there is nothing and there is to become something. The beginning is no pure nothing, but a nothing from which something is to proceed; therefore being, too, is already contained in the beginning. The beginning, therefore, contains both, being and nothing, is the unity of being and nothing; or is non-being which is at the same time being, and being which is at the same time non-being.
